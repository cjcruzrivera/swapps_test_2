# Swapps technical test

Test 2: solving programming problems test

## Problem description

Having a string of random characters and random length, create a method that identifies how
many substrings of 4 characters appear more than once along the main string. The methodâ€™s
only argument should be the main string.
It should return the substrings that repeat and how many times they appear in the text in a data
structure.

## Install and use
* For proper use, the test should be performed on a Unix system with python 3 installed.

~~~
$ git clone https://github.com/cjcruzrivera/swapps_test_1.git
~~~

* You can test the main file directly or if you need, you can move the method.py file to your own project, and include on your code like that.

~~~
from method import getFourLenSubStringRepeated

string = "main string"
results = getFourLenSubStringRepeated(string)
~~~

For test with main file, only needs to execute it.

~~~
$ python main.py

===
Insert the main string to analyze:  (insert string here)
===

If there isn't any result.
Output:
There aren't substrings of 4 characters that appear more than once along the main string.

If there are results.
Output:
Dict {
    "substring": "how many times they appear"
}
